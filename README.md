  The following steps are included:

  Univariate Analysis (with Feature Engineering)

  Significant Featuring (using corelation matrix and VIF)

  Machine Learning Modelling with hyperparameter tuning
  
  Models Analysis
  
  
*ConclusionÂ¶*
  
Feature named MissedAppointments which was not present in dataset initially,After figuring it out, found it has the most corelated feature to the dependent variable, it makes sense that behavior of previous instances is helpful to predict the current instance whether the patient is going to showup or not. Finally, Able to predict with 92% Accuracy
