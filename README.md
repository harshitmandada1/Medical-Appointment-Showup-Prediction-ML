  The objective of this repository is to produce an best model to predict an appointment's no-show, given a patient. The data set shows information of appointments in public hospitals in Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil.

  The following steps will be followed:

  Univariate Analysis (with Feature Engineering)

  *Significant Featuring (using corelation matrix and VIF)*

  *LogisticRegression (Hyperparameter Tuning)*

  *SVM(Hyperparamter Tuning)*

  *DecisionTree Classifier and Boosting it.*

  *RandomForest (Hyperparameter Tuning)*

  *Models Analysis*
